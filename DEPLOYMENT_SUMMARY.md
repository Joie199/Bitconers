## 🚀 What Happens Next

### Automatic (Vercel):
1. **Vercel detects push** to GitHub main branch
2. **Build starts automatically** (usually within 30 seconds)
3. **Deployment completes** (2-3 minutes)
4. **Site goes live** at your production URL

### Manual Steps Needed:

#### 1. Verify Supabase Storage (2 minutes)
- [ ] Go to Supabase Dashboard → Storage
- [ ] Create bucket: `profile_img`
- [ ] Set to **Public**
- [ ] This enables profile image uploads

#### 2. Check Vercel Deployment (1 minute)
- [ ] Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
- [ ] Find your project: `pan-africa-bitcoin-academy`
- [ ] Wait for deployment to complete (green checkmark)
- [ ] Click on deployment to see logs

#### 3. Verify Environment Variables (1 minute)
- [ ] Vercel → Settings → Environment Variables
- [ ] Verify all are set:
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
  - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

#### 4. Test Production Site (5 minutes)
Visit your production URL and test:
- [ ] User registration
- [ ] User login
- [ ] Profile update
- [ ] Image upload
- [ ] Password change
- [ ] Logout

## 📋 Quick Checklist

- [x] Database migrations run
- [x] Code pushed to GitHub
- [ ] Supabase Storage bucket created
- [ ] Vercel deployment verified

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Password Reset Emails
Currently, password reset generates tokens but doesn't send emails. In development, check Vercel function logs for reset links. For production, integrate an email service (Resend recommended).

### Monitoring
After deployment:
- Monitor Vercel function logs for errors
- Check Supabase usage and limits
- Test all features thoroughly
- Monitor user feedback

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Wait for Vercel deployment** (2-3 minutes)
2. **Create Supabase Storage bucket** (if not done)
3. **Test production site** thoroughly
4. **Set up email service** (optional, for password reset emails)
5. **Monitor for issues** in first 24 hours

## ✨ You're Almost There!

Your code is deployed. Just:
1. Wait for Vercel to finish building
2. Create the storage bucket
3. Test everything

**Status**: 🚀 Deploying to production!
